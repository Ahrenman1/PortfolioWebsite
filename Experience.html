          As the second busiest Co-operative store in Scotland, I was able to
          gain valuable experience working in a fast paced environment, whilst
          also being integrated with strong team of 20 who I formed very close
          friendships with. It was always improtant to me to come in every day
          with a positive attitude, and maintain this even when things did not
          go according to plan.
          <br />
          <br />
          On first glance, a job in retail might seem very different to
          technical roles within an engineering company, but the vast variety of
          transferable skills I developed while at the Co-op is something which
          has benefitted me immensely throughout University and social life, and
          I am certain these skills will be easily applicable to engineering
          roles. Over the summers, I served thousands of customers and worked
          with incredible people. My salesmanship and ability to adapt to
          different personalities can be applied anywhere, along with my
          commitment and organisation to tasks to ensure they were completed on
          time and to a high standard.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not only did my verbal communication improve substantially, my ability
          to listen was also heightened. I became more confident, efficient and
          flexible around the shops variety of working hours, being on hand to
          help out when others were overwhelmed with the demands of the day.
