          As the second busiest Co-operative store in Scotland, I was able to
          gain valuable experience working in a fast paced environment, whilst
          also being integrated with strong team of 20 who I formed very close
          friendships with. It was always important to me to come in every day
          with a positive attitude, and maintain this even when things did not
          go according to plan.
          <br />
          <br />
          There is a reason I chose to spent three summers at the Co-op. On
          first glance, a job in retail might seem very different to technical
          roles within an engineering company, but the vast variety of
          transferable skills I developed while at the Co-op is something which
          has benefitted me immensely throughout University and social life, and
          I am certain these skills will be easily applicable to engineering
          roles. Over these summers, I served thousands of customers and worked
          with incredible people. My salesmanship and ability to adapt to
          different personalities can be applied anywhere, along with my
          commitment and organisation to tasks to ensure they were completed on
          time and to a high standard.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not only did my verbal communication improve substantially, my ability
          to listen was also heightened. I became more confident, efficient and
          flexible around the shops variety of working hours, being on hand to
          help out when others were overwhelmed with the demands of the day.

          Working in Marks and Spencers had many areas to work, be it the stock,
          tills, refund desk, shop floor etc. This made me more capable of
          adapting to different tasks. A key consideration in the shop was the
          presentation of the stock, so a lot of my time was dedicated to
          presentation.
          <br />
          <br />
          I also engaged with a large number of customers, a lot of which
          required an extra helping hand with their shopping. It was therefore
          important to always be patient, understanding and positive to provide
          the best experience.

          I worked at the South Ayrshire Swim Team as a swim coach after being a
          member of the team for 11 years. I got to use my skills in swimming to
          train the younger members of the team, so that they could move up
          squads and compete to the best of their ability.
          <br />
          <br />
          The work involved communicating with a large group of children, and
          presenting the lesson material in the most engaging format to keep the
          attention of the class. It was also important to communicate with
          other coaches working on the same lesson, to ensure the experience was
          consistent and well organised.

        <p>
          In 2014, I was one of the few students across Scotland selected to
          attend the Scottish Space School. It had a large effect on my
          confidence, and helped solidify my aspirations to work in engineering.
          The week consisted of group activities, getting presentations from
          astronauts, engineers and scientists from NASA, and gaining invaluable
          experience of being a student and learning about the University of
          Strathclyde.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the most important aspects was getting to meet likeminded
          people from across the Scotland and the UK. Learning about the impact
          of the space industry, and the emerging technical capability of the
          Scottish Space sector, was very exciting. The experience still effects
          me positively to this day, and I gained many friendships that have
          lasted ever since then.
