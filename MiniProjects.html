            This aim of this project was to mechanically design and test a
            marble run in SolidWorks. It involved seven unique phases, including
            a spiral, upwards staircase, loop the loop etc. The motion study
            performed had to capture the entire lifecycle of the marble, and had
            to return to the start position. The project was also open ended,
            meaning I could be creative my design decisions.

            This was a group systems engineering task to develop several neural
            networks to try to predict the level of pollution in a given area in
            Beijing based on easy to measure environmental factors (rainfall,
            temperature etc). This was to mitigate the use of expensive sensors
            to calculate exact pollution levels. My main task was to model the
            multi-layer perceptron classification network, and the deep learning
            regression network, to produce results that were similar to the
            actual pollution levels.

            The objective of this project was to modify a toy car to navigate an
            obstacle course, avoiding white lines and walls, to reach a finish
            line. it was done with a team. This was a competition against other
            classmates to see who could complete the course, and who could do it
            the fastest. My main task was building and fitting a frame around
            the robot that housed the sensors and electronics, so that none of
            the design rules were broken. I was also heavily involved with
            coding the STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller within the car. Our group
            came 5th out of 12 teams.

            This was a team project that was tasked with designing and testing a
            deep learning network capable of categorising images into distinct
            categories of posture, to aid in rehabilitation and nursing homes.
            The optimised cost function of the stochastic gradient descent
            method (SGD) was used to train image datasets of 4 different
            categories. The network was purposefully made small to reduce the
            latency of inputting an image and receiving an output, in order to
            produce live feedback of a video stream from a webcam.

            I have always wanted to develop my own portfolio, and it was
            important for me to do it by programming in HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript, instead of using drag and drop tools such as Wix, so
            that I could derive more control over my design. I used Visual
            Studio Code, and developed thousands of lines of code to put this
            site together, as well as using Git and GitHub to manage the code. I
            thoroughly enjoyed being creative and will continue to make changes
            to the website as my career progresses.
