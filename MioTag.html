          This project served as my Master's thesis at the University of
          Strathclyde. It was completed alongside my teammates, Filip Lejhanec,
          Wojtek Cichoradzki, Fraser Martin and Leo McKeever.

          The aim of the project was to develop a smart glove which connects
          with a mobile device to creater an interactive platform to assist with
          the rehabilitation of nerve damage victims, primarily stroke patients.

          I developed the concept for the platform in late 2018, and spent my
          dissertation (Wi-Fi Activity Monitor) building the foundations, before
          forming a strong team and pitching the idea to the University
          department for my Master's project. I was the project manager and lead
          hardware developer of the project, and found the development process
          to be very fulfilling and creative.

          After noticing the difficulty surrounding stroke rehabilitation, such
          as long wait times, few available appointments, and a lack of
          compelling rehabilitation exercises, I devised the platform to provide
          a much cheaper and more engaging experience. The user can complete
          exercises and participate in games while wearing the glove, and then
          log these activities to their account to be viewed by themselves (to
          improve motivation) and their clinicians (to track progress). The app
          is also social, with friends and family able to connect with each
          other to provide a community of support.

          As the project lead, I was responsible for guiding the outcome in the
          right direction, using my initial vision of what the platform could
          become as inspiration. I was solely responsible for the design and
          manufacture of the glove frame, which housed the electronics. This
          involved using CAD extensively to develop not only the frame, but
          inverse of the frame to make the mould for the rubber to be poured in.
          I was also largely involved with the electronic development, as I
          selected all the components and built the PCB on EasyEDA in
          conjunction with Leo McKeever and Filip Lejhanec.

          The final product was of a very high standard and conformed to the
          requirements set out initially, even in the midst of a global
          pandemic. The prototype was relatively cheap at Â£150, lightweight and
          easy to use. The elastic rubber that was used in the frame allowed for
          the glove to be universally sized, meaning it was as inclusive as
          possible. The final product offered one touch activation, wireless
          charging and a well designed mobile app. To get a full overview,
