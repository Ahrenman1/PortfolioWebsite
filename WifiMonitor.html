          This project was my 4<sup>th</sup> year dissertation project, and the
          goal was to develop a device that could monitor motion and provide
          feedback to a user. The project was open ended, so I decided real time
          feedback would be the most useful and effective. In essence, this
          project developed the fundamentals that I used for my 5<sup>th</sup>
          year smart glove project, MioTag. To give a high level overview of the
          project, I was to develop the software and hardware of a device to
          produce a monitoring platform that physiotherapists and users could
          use to track and motivate progress, through real time audio and visual
          feedback, and a database.

          I used many languages that worked together in this project to produce
          the final output, the main of which being Python. I used Python to
          transmit data over a WebSocket TCP, using a Raspberry Pi and a
          SenseHat to give reliable orientation data. This data transmitted to a
          mobile application developed by MIT App Inventor to prototype it. Once
          an activity was complete, the user could submit it to a web server
          hosted on Digital Ocean, where backend PHP I developed communicated
          with a SQL database to store and access information about users.

          An individual project like this required a lot of self-motivation and
          creativity, as it was very open ended. The vast number of disciplines
          covered (device, application, server and database) meant that I had to
          be very versatile and motivated to learn new things. The end result
          fulfilled all the main requirements, with a novel concept for remote
          rehabilitation now being available to build on. On top of this, my
          confidence in programming increased largely.

          This project received a high mark (76%), and was essential in giving
          the 5<sup>th</sup> year masters project a strong headstart into
          development, as my research, concepts and algorithms could be applied
          in the context of a team to further development of MioTag. A full
          video of this project can be found by following the link in the header
          of this page.
