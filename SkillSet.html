          Not so much a language, but I used this a lot over my University
          years. Developed a bouncing ball model for Systems Engineering
          analysis, and for DSP filtering with Xilinx Tools.

          I learned about the principles and derivation of orbital mechanics at
          University, and enjoyed implementing them in MATLAB simulations where
          my team and I devised and tested a satellite constellation around the
          moon.

          I studied some low level microcontroller programming in University,
          but took it further outside University by completing Udemy courses on
          embedded C, driver development and communcation protocols out of
          personal interest.

          Take this website as evidence! I really enjoyed working on this site,
          and put a lot of effort into the design, scalability (changing screen
          size) and the file management of it.

          As part of my image and video processing classes, I learned a lot
          about CNN's, regression networks, multilayer perceptrons etc. I also
          completed several projects which centred about deep learning, such as
          for posture detection and Beijing pollution.
