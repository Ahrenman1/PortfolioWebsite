          The task assigned to each team was to devise a satellite constellation
          to be set up around the moon that would provide total coverage of the
          surface by at least 4 satellites at once. Each team was given creative
          freedom to model and simulate results, so our team selected MATLAB to
          verify and validate that our constellation fulfilled the main
          objectives.

          There were many requirements to conform to, including the solar
          eclipse period and the launch windows, but my main task was to
          simulate the ground coverage to ensure our constellation operated
          correctly. The code was developed from scratch using the orbital
          mechanics equations derived throughout the class, and gives a visual
          animation of the satellites orbiting about the moon. The moon surface
          colour changes (shown in animation above) reflect how many satellites
          can be seen by that point on the surface at any given time (Purple =
          6, Light Blue = 5, Red = 4, Black = less than 4). The code could be
          easily modified to change the semi major axis, eccentricity,
          prograde/retrograde, no. satellites on each orbit, and all angles of
          orbit (inclination etc.).

          Two other aspects I was responsible included modelling the
          pertubations into the ground coverage (animation exaggerates
          pertubations to show them more clearly), and animating the orbit
          transfer of the satellite from the carrier to the constellation. This
          can be shown in the above and left animations respectively. The
          success of my tasks were very reliant on strong communication between
          other team members. These results were presented, to back up our
          design decisions, and we were delighted to have defended our
          constellation succesfully, without any changes needed.

          The graphs opposite illustate the total ground coverage by a minimum
          of 4, 5 and 6 satellites. The left graph is when 3 satellites are
          present on each orbit, and the right is for 4 on each orbit. The left
          graph takes several dips in 100% coverage by 4 satellites, hence it
          fails the objective and reinforces our decision for 4 satellites per
          orbit. Since the orbit is periodic, there will always be coverage by 4
          satellites across the moon with this arrangement. All code was managed
          using Git and GitHub, with my teammates Duncan Wither and Laurence
          Donkers.
