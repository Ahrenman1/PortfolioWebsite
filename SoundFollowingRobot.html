          This is a team project I completed in my third year of University. The
          goal was to develop a robot that was capable of following noise of a
          specific frequency. The robot was to be intelligent enough to
          disregard frequencies that it was not tuned to find, and also have
          obstacle avoidance capabilities. The project was very open creatively,
          and allowed us to put our own spin on the design and functionality of
          the robot.

          A Raspberry Pi 3 was selected to process the sound and control the
          motors. In the Raspberry Pi, the Idle IDE was used, hence Python was
          the programming language running in the robot. A mini USB microphone,
          Ultrasound sensor and L293D motor controller were integrated to make
          the robot fully operational.

          My role in the team was project manager and programming lead. I was
          responsible for the building, integration and testing of components to
          produce the final result. It was exciting to have practical
          applications of skills developed throughout University, and my ability
          in Python improved substantially, as well as my interpersonal skills
          in a team dynamic.

          The result of the project was a fully autonomous robot capable of
          being tuned to follow any frequency between 100Hz and 20,000Hz, and
          with obstacle avoidance algorithms built in. A creative twist on
          similar projects was the small size of the robot, allowing it more
          mobility and less power consumption. The demonstration and
          presentation went excellently, with the robot conforming perfectly to
          the initial brief and requirements. The team received a high mark for
          this work.
